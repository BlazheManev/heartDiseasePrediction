# Heart Disease Prediction

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of heart disease based on various medical and demographic factors. We'll utilize machine learning techniques to build a model that can assist in early heart disease detection.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains the following features:

1. Age
2. Sex (1 = male, 2 = female)
3. Chest pain type (4 values)
4. Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
5. Serum cholestrol in mg/dl
6. Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)
7. Resting electrocardiographic results (values 0, 1, 2)
8. Maximum heart rate achieved
9. Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
10. Oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11. The slope of the peak exercise ST segment
12. Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
13. Thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversible defect

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies. You can do this by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook `Projekt.ipynb` to perform data analysis, preprocessing, and model training.
4. Explore the code to understand how the machine learning model works.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

- The project begins with exploratory data analysis, including visualizations, to understand the dataset and identify patterns.

## Data Preprocessing

- Data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and converting categorical data into numerical form.

## Model Building

- The heart disease prediction model is built using various machine learning algorithms, including Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Extra Trees, AdaBoost, and Gradient Boosting.

## Model Evaluation

- The models are evaluated for accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and more. The results are displayed for each algorithm.

## Clustering

- Clustering techniques like K-means, hierarchical clustering, and spectral clustering are applied to gain insights into the data's natural grouping.

## Conclusion

This project aims to help in early heart disease detection through machine learning and data analysis. Feel free to explore the code and make improvements or customizations as needed.
